    "2. BigBird\n",
    "Model: google/bigbird-roberta-base\n",

    "Model: facebook/bart-large-LED\n",
    "Description: This model is built on Longformer and is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, like summarization, while supporting longer inputs.OSError: facebook/bart-large-LED is not a local folder and is not a valid model identifier listed on 'https://huggingface.co/models'\n",
    "If this is a private repository, make sure to pass a token having permission to this repo either by logging in with `huggingface-cli login` or by passing `token=<your_token>`\n",
    "4. GPT-3 or GPT-4 (if accessible)\n",
    "Description: If you have access to OpenAI’s API for GPT models, they can generate summaries for large texts effectively. You might need to break your text into smaller parts, but they handle context well."

    "HOW TO DISABLE SCRIPT EXECUTION VIA WEB Disabling script execution in a web-accessible upload directory is crucial for preventing the execution of malicious scripts. Here are several methods to achieve this, depending on the web server you are using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using .htaccess (for Apache)\n",
    "If you are using Apache as your web server, you can create or modify a .htaccess file in your upload directory to disable script execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# .htaccess file in the upload directory\n",
    "<FilesMatch \"\\.(php|pl|cgi|py|jsp|asp|sh|rb)$\">\n",
    "    Order Allow,Deny\n",
    "    Deny from all\n",
    "</FilesMatch>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternatively, to deny access to all scripts\n",
    "Options -ExecCGI\n",
    "AddHandler cgi-script .pl .py .jsp .asp .sh .rb\n",
    "2. Using Nginx Configuration\n",
    "For Nginx, you can configure the server block to disable script execution in the upload directory. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "nginx\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "location /uploads/ {\n",
    "    # Deny access to script files\n",
    "    location ~ \\.(php|pl|cgi|py|jsp|asp|sh|rb)$ {\n",
    "        deny all;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    # Serve other files normally\n",
    "    autoindex on;\n",
    "}\n",
    "3. Rename the Upload Directory\n",
    "Consider naming the upload directory in a way that avoids common script extensions. For instance, you can use a name that doesn’t imply execution, like uploads_files/. This approach helps, but is not foolproof.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change File Permissions\n",
    "Ensure that the permissions of the upload directory do not allow script execution. For instance, in a Linux environment, you can set the permissions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "chmod 755 uploads/\n",
    "5. Use a Separate Domain or Subdomain\n",
    "Consider serving uploaded files from a separate domain or subdomain that does not allow script execution. This isolates your main application and reduces risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. File Validation and Sanitization\n",
    "Even if script execution is disabled, always validate and sanitize filenames and file content to ensure no harmful files are uploaded. This can include checking the file type and size as discussed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)\n",
    "If applicable, implement a Content Security Policy to control resources the user agent is allowed to load. This doesn’t prevent script execution directly but adds an additional layer of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keep Uploads Outside the Web Root\n",
    "If possible, store uploads outside the web root directory. This is the most secure option, as it prevents direct access via the web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Implementation for .htaccess\n",
    "Here’s an example .htaccess file that could be placed in your uploads directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Deny execution of scripts\n",
    "<FilesMatch \"\\.(php|pl|cgi|py|jsp|asp|sh|rb)$\">\n",
    "    Order Allow,Deny\n",
    "    Deny from all\n",
    "</FilesMatch>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disable CGI script execution\n",
    "Options -ExecCGI\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "By implementing these methods, you can significantly reduce the risk of script execution in your upload directory and enhance the security of your application. Always combine these measures with other security practices for optimal protection."

    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "chown www-data:www-data uploads\n",
    "4. Set File Permissions for Uploaded Files\n",
    "When files are uploaded, you should set their permissions to 644. This allows the owner to read and write the file, while others can only read it:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
